## Features
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [ROOM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components updating app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
* [Dagger - Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/) Build beautiful, usable products using Material Components for Android.
