* [Dagger - Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/) Build beautiful, usable products using Material Components for Android.
